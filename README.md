Completion Date: Nov 28, 2016

This is the repository for my completion of the freeCodeCamp "Build a Pomodoro Clock" project. Formatted for mobile use.

A working version is at https://codepen.io/cojamalo/pen/PbmgLO.

The project is an example of a Javascript timer using css animations. Project coded by Connor Lenio - released into the public domain for educational purposes in 2016. Coordinates from click adapted from work by Emanuele Feronato. SVG pie timer adapted from work by Anders Grimsrud.
